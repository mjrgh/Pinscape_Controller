    // Tolerance range for timing inaccuracies, as a percentage +/- of the 
    // reference time from the protocol specification.  Our measured signal
    // times will never exactly match the specification times, because
    // neither the receiver nor the transmitter have perfect clocks.  And
    // even if we had a perfect clock, we'd still be a little off due to
    // latencies in the detector hardware, the detector's signal processing
    // (demodulation, filtering), and our own latencies in detecting and
    // responding to signals on the input pin.  So we need to add a little
    // wiggle room in interpreting times: if the spec says we should see an 
    // X-microsecond IR-ON state (a "mark"), we can expect it to actually
    // range from X-error to X+error.  This tolerance value sets the error
    // range we'll accept.
    //
    // Typical Arduino IR receiver implementations use 30% tolerances.  I 
    // think we could be quite a bit tighter than that if we wanted to be,
    // since the biggest source of timing inaccuracies on the Arduino systems
    // is probably the Arduino itself - the CPU is fairly slow to start with,
    // and most of the Arduino code I've seen uses polling to detect signal
    // edges, which is inherently high-latency.  We're on a relatively fast
    // CPU, and we use interrupts to detect edges.  In my own measurements
    // of miscellaneous remotes, our readings seem to be within about 3% of 
    // spec, so I think 30% is far looser than we really need to be.
    //
    // The main reason to prefer tighter tolerances is that we want to
    // work with many different transmitters from different vendors, using 
    // different protocols.  Higher tolerances mean more ambiguity in
    // identifying timing signatures.  The tradeoff, of course, is that a
    // lower tolerance means more chance of rejecting borderline signals
    // that we could have interpreted properly.  This will probably have
    // to be fine-tuned over time based on practical experience.  For now,
    // it appears that the super loose Arduino levels work just fine, in
    // that we can still easily identify protocols.
